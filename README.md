# Qubit Circle Animation — 10,000 Points

A **real-time qubit visualization** where 10,000 points animate within a circle, representing |0⟩ and |1⟩ states.

### Features
- Efficient animation of 10,000 moving points on canvas.
- Distinct red/blue coloring for |0⟩ and |1⟩ halves.
- Oscillating wave patterns to mimic quantum superposition.
- Boundary checks ensure the circle outline remains stable.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Canvas 2D optimization for high-performance rendering.
- Data visualization of qubit states.
- Creative representation of binary quantum states.

### Run Instructions
Open `QubitCircleAnimation.html` in a browser.  
Observe the animated points moving between |0⟩ (red) and |1⟩ (blue).
